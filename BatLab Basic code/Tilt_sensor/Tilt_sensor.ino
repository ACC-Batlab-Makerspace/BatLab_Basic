/* BatLab Basic Project Kit
 Tilt Sensor/switch example
Wiring note: the 10Kâ„¦ resistor is used here to "pull up" the signal to 5V when the switch is open(sensor is tilted), ensuring that the Arduino reads a HIGH in that case;  when the sensor is upright, the mercury closes the circuit and the signal is connected to ground, or 0V, so the Arduino then reads a LOW. Without the pull up resistor, the signal will "float" when the switch is open and you will get unpredictable results from reading the pin.
