/* POTENTIOMETER â€“ BLINK AN LED
  
Hardware connections:

  Potentiometer:
  
    Potentiometers have three pins. When we're using it as a
    voltage divider, we connect the outside pins to power and
    ground. The middle pin will be the signal (a voltage which
    varies from 0 Volts to 5 Volts depending on the position of
    the knob).

    Connect the middle pin to ANALOG IN pin 0 on the Arduino.
    Connect one of the outside pins to 5V.
    Connect the other outside pin to GND.

    (TIP: if once your program is running, the knob feels
    "backwards", you can swap the 5V and GND pins to reverse
    the direction.)
    
  LED:

  Connect the positive side of your LED (longer leg) to
   Arduino DIGITAL pin 9
      
  Connect the negative side of your LED (shorter leg) to a 220 Ohm resistor
      
  Connect the other side of the resistor to ground.

// In this sketch we'll start using "variables."

// A variable is a named number. We'll often use these to store
// numbers that change, such as measurements from the outside
// world, or to make a sketch easier to understand (sometimes a
// descriptive name makes more sense than looking at a number).

// Variables can be different "data types", which is the kind of
// number we're using (can it be negative? Have a decimal point?)
// We'll introduce more data types later, but for the moment we'll
// stick with good old "integers" (called "int" in your sketch).

// You must "declare" variables before you use them, so that the
// computer knows about them. Here we'll declare two integer
// variables, and at the same time, initialize them to specific
// values. We're doing this so that further down, we can refer to
// the pins by name rather than number.

// Note that variable names are case-sensitive! If you get an
// "(variable) was not declared in this scope" error, double-check
// that you typed the name correctly.

// Here we're creating a variable called "sensorPin" of type "int"
// and initializing it to have the value "0":

int sensorPin = 0;    // The potentiometer is connected to
                      // analog pin 0
                      
int ledPin = 9;      // The LED is connected to digital pin 9


void setup()  
{
  
  
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  
  // The above line is the same as "pinMode(9, OUTPUT);"

  // You might be wondering why we're not also configuring
  // sensorPin as an input. The reason is that this is an
  // "analog in" pin. These pins have the special ability to
  // read varying voltages from sensors like the potentiometer.
  // Since they're always used as inputs, there is no need to
  // specifically configure them.
}


void loop() 

{
  // First we'll declare another integer variable
  // to store the value of the potentiometer:

  int sensorValue;

  // The Arduino can read external voltages on the analog input
  // pins using a built-in function called analogRead(). This
  // function takes one input value, the analog pin we're using
  // (sensorPin, which we earlier set to 0). It returns an integer
  // number that ranges from 0 (0 Volts) to 1023 (5 Volts).
  // We're sticking this value into the sensorValue variable:

  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);    

  // Now we'll blink the LED like in the first example, but we'll
  // use the sensorValue variable to change the blink speed
  // (the smaller the number, the faster it will blink).

  // Note that we're using the ledPin variable here as well:

  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);     // Turn the LED on

  delay(sensorValue);             // Pause for sensorValue
                                  // milliseconds
  
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);      // Turn the LED off

  delay(sensorValue);             // Pause for sensorValue
                                  // milliseconds
  
  // Remember that loop() repeats forever, so we'll do all this
  // again and again.
